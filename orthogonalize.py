    Iterative orthogonalization of columns of a tall matrix.
    
    The output matrix (Q) is differentiable with respect to the input matrix (Q0).

    Args:
        Q0: some random matrix (cannot be degenerate like a matrix of zeros)
        max_iters: maximum number of iterations to run before stopping
        stop_early: whether the loop would terminate if ||Q.T @ Q - I||_F < some tolerance
        tol: used together with stop_early; ignored unless stop_early is true
    
    Returns:
        Q: an orthogonal matrix derived from Q0
        i: number of iterations it tooks for orthogonalization to complete
